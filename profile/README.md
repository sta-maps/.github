# STA-Maps: Sociotechnical Architecture Maps 

Sociotechnical Architecture Maps (STA-Maps) offer open and adaptable elements for the visualization of sociotechnical systems and architectures. They are able to provide a holistic overview of the building blocks and espcially their dynamics and dependencies for complex and adaptive systems. STA-Maps aim to be flexible and help in visualizing and discussing the trade-offs of complex sociotechnical systems and their evolution. Explicitly STA-Maps offer no best practices or one-size-fits-all solutions.
